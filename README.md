# -Basic-Speech-Recognition

This is a simple speech recognition tool built using Python's `speech_recognition` library. It listens for voice commands and performs predefined actions based on the recognized commands.

## Features

- Recognizes voice commands such as "start", "stop", "pause", "resume", "shut down", and "turn off".
- Provides feedback for unrecognized commands.

## How It Works

This tool uses Google's Web Speech API to recognize spoken commands. The recognized text is then matched against a set of predefined commands to trigger corresponding actions.
